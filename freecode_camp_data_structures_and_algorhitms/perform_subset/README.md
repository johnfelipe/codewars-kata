***Data Structures: Perform a Subset Check on Two Sets of Data***

In this exercise we are going to perform a subset test on 2 sets of data. We will create a method on our Set data structure called subset. This will compare the first set, against the second and if the first set is fully contained within the Second then it will return true.

```javascript
For example, if setA = ['a','b'] and setB = ['a','b','c','d'], then the subset of setA and setB is: setA.subset(setB) should be true.
```
