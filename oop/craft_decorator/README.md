The Decorator Design Pattern can be used, for example, in the StarCraft game to manage upgrades.

The pattern consists in "incrementing" your base class with extra functionality.

A decorator will receive an instance of the base class and use it to create a new instance with the new things you want "added on it".

***Your Task***
